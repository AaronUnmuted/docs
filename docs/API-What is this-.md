We at SHOUTca.st enjoy a "hacker lifestyle". Before you ask, no, that doesn't mean we hack into systems, it just means we love changing systems to meet our needs. This allows us to serve you the best possible. But why would we limit this power to ourselves? We love power users, and that is why we opened up our APIs so you can build software that works great with our services!

Almost all of the services we built have APIs following the REST standard. This makes it universally usable to everybody. You can find all available functions here in the documentation.

We believe open source is the future! Our systems are fully dependent on open source software, so why would we keep ours closed? We have open sourced projects like Cast and Player. Soon, ITFrame and Control are to follow. You can find them all on [GitHub](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies).
