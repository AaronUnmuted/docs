## Where can I find a player for my website?

We suggest taking a look at our own solution called [Player](doc:player). If you're on the free account or prefer something else you can take a look at [Muses](http://muses.org). The URL required to set this up can be find in Links in Control or Quick Links in Centova Cast.
