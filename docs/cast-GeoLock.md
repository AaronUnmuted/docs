title: "GeoLock"

GeoLock is built in into Cast to comply with some licensing issues for music. Some licensing agencies ask to block access in countries where they have no rights to play the music. Cast can be configured to only allow certain countries to tune in to your stream.

## Black- vs Whitelisting
Cast has two options a blacklist and a whitelist. The whitelist option allows only certain countries to tune in. All others including non-identifiable will not have access to the stream. 
A blacklist does the exact opposite, this will ban certain countries but allow non-identifiable IPs.
