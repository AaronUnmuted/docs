Cast's statistics plugin is currently in active development. We'll be deploying this in small updates to the network. This way we can troubleshoot individual parts and make sure not to serve invalid information.

Not yet. We're looking into a simple and flexible way to export this info. Are you a developer? Then you might want to take a look at our API.

The statistics API is designed to be fully open and serve you the same information as we use. Since the system is not exclusive to the hosted Cast service we offer the documentation can be found at https://cast.readme.io/docs. The API can be accessed via your URL and API key.
