title: "API"

The Cast server itself also has an API. You can find the documentation for that in the [official documentation for Cast](https://cast.readme.io).

The links you need for the API are under *Links* in Control.

Cast supports most of the SHOUTcast and Icecast APIs, should you find something that does not work feel free to contact our team to add support for it!
