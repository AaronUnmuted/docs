title: "Clocks"

Clocks are the daily playlists that are played on your station. In some systems they are called *rotations*.

A clock can be set on a weekly basis, you can set them to a specific day and time of the week. This week wil repeat itself as long as it isn't changed. If you want to limit clocks until a certain date â€” it's probably better go for a playlist. 

A clock is always comprised of a specific percentage of tags. This is the amount of songs from that tag that will be played during the clock. These songs will be played in a random order. All clocks will follow the separation rules set to comply with your local laws. 

You must have a clock active for a specific day or time. DJ will always resume to playing the music listed in the Clock if a playlist failed to play or ended before time. This is to prevent dead air.
