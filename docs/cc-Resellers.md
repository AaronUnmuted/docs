A reseller account is a special Centova Cast account that allows you to create multiple sub-accounts. It is made to resell these and make money using it. 

## Can I automate my sales?

Yes you can, but not in Centova Cast itself. There are some software suites available that automate billing and the creation of the accounts such as [WHMCS](https://whmcs.com). 
> WHMCS is not the best out there, the software has some flaws and design issues. If you know a better alternative that supports Centova Cast resellers feel free to suggest it to us.


## Can I use extra services?

Resellers are meant to be while-label. That means your services won't have our name on it. That is why the extra services like Player,Twitter and TuneIn are not available to resellers.

## Can I use a reseller for my own use?
