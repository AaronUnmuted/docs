We accept all major credit and debit cards such as Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, Discover, etc. We also accept PayPal, Bitcoin,  instant bank transfers via Sofort or Direct Debit via GoCardless. 

## What currencies can I pay in?

You can pay in British Pounds (GBP), US Dollars (USD) and Euros (EUR). We will update the price once a month to reflect the current exchange rate. We do not charge any fees on these unlike most banks do. 

### Can i change my currency

No. Our billing system doesn't allow this. If you do want to change this we advice to create a new account with the correct currency and ask our support to move your services to the new account. 

## Do you charge automatically?

We do charge credit/debit cards and direct debit automatically. If you want this behaviour turned off you can create a support ticket for this.

To use Direct Debit (EUR, GBP only) make sure this is your default payment method on your account. To do this open "Edit Account Details"

There under payment method select "Direct Debit (GoCardless). Then save the settings.
To complete the setup make sure you have paid at least one invoice with Direct Debit setup. 

### Why did you discontinue PayPal subscriptions?

We have changed the way our system handles foreigh exchange rates, these now can change over time to reflect the actual rate. PayPal Subscriptions work like a "standing order" and send a specific amount of money on a specific date, with us being unable to change this. This caused issues on up/downgrades as well as exchange rates. This also affects usage based plans like Cast with DJ and the Pro+ plan. This is why we disabled this feature and replaced it with automatic card and direct debit payments, unlike PayPal these allow us to take a different amount every month,

## My card payment failed

If your card got rejected or when an invoice is not marked paid after a payment this means our system was not able to receive a successful payment. Therefor our payment processor can not confirm and send the money to us. 
If you still see a charge on your account, that can be a *pending* charge. Meaning it won't settle. If you are unsure about this we suggest to contact your bank. 

In case you get any error on the payment we suggest contacting your bank for the exact reason for the failure or trying an alternative method such as PayPal.

## Remove my card or cancel direct debit

If you want to remove your card or cancel your direct debit you can do this in the Client Area under Billing -> Manage Credit Card. This page will allow you to save a new credit or debit card or to delete your existing one.

## Can I pay with X?

We already offer a lot of different payment methods which are accessible to most, if not all people. We probably won't add any more unless there is a big demand, as adding new payment methods costs money and time to us.

In most cases, if you cannot pay via PayPal, you still have the option of using your credit/debit card. If that isn't possible either, there are still bank transfers and Bitcoins.

## Can I pay with Western Union?

**No.** We will never support Western Union because of the high risk for fraud and the impossibility to integrate it with our systems.

## What are funds/credit

In the Client Area you can add funds to your account. These will be credited on your account like a "pay to go" plan and used to auto-pay all future invoices (note: if you have invoices open the funds will **not** cover those).

On the same page you can check what your current balance is.
