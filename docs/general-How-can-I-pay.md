title: "How can I pay?"

---
We accept all major credit and debit cards such as Visa, MasterCard, Maestro (Bancontact/Mister Cash in Belgium), Discover, etc. We also accept PayPal, Bitcoin,  instant bank transfers via Sofort or Direct Debit via GoCardless. 

## What currencies can I pay in?

You can pay in British Pounds (GBP), US Dollars (USD) and Euros (EUR). You will keep paying the price you see on your first invoice, so if you chose Euro, you will keep paying that price in Euro and are not affected by any changes in the currency market.
> **A special case: discounts**
> Some discounts only apply for the initial invoice. This means that you will pay a discounted price for the first invoice, and the full price for subsequent invoices.


## Do you charge automatically?

We do charge credit/debit cards and direct debit automatically. If you want this behaviour turned off you can create a support ticket for this.

To use Direct Debit (EUR, GBP only) make sure this is your default payment method on your account. To do this open "Edit Account Details"

There under payment method select "Direct Debit (GoCardless). Then save the settings.
To complete the setup make sure you have paid at least one invoice with Direct Debit setup. 


## My card payment failed

If your card got rejected or when an invoice is not marked paid after a payment this means our system was not able to receive a successful payment. Therefor our payment processor can not confirm and send the money to us. 
If you still see a charge on your account, that can be a *pending* charge. Meaning it won't settle. If you are unsure about this we suggest to contact your bank. 

In case you get any error on the payment we suggest contacting your bank for the exact reason for the failure or trying an alternative method such as PayPal.

## Can I pay with X?

We already offer a lot of different payment methods which are accessible to most, if not all people. We probably won't add any more unless there is a big demand, as adding new payment methods costs money and time to us.

In most cases, if you cannot pay via PayPal, you still have the option of using your credit/debit card. If that isn't possible either, there are still bank transfers and Bitcoins.

## Can I pay with Western Union?

**No.** We will never support Western Union because of the high risk for fraud and the impossibility to integrate it with our systems.

## What are funds/credit

In the Client Area you can add funds to your account. These will be credited on your account and used to auto-pay all future invoices (note: if you have invoices open the funds will not cover those).
