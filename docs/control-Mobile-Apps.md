## Requesting your apps

In Control, click on *Manage* in the navigation bar.

Still in the navigation bar, select the service for which you wish to request apps by clicking on the service switcher.

Click on *Submit a request* to submit an app request for your service.

Fill in the form properly without ignoring the guidelines and tips, then submit the form. Control will then reload to confirm your submission.

You will be notified whenever your app is submitted and if there are any issues with your request.

This is especially true when we have an issue with our build system or developer account, or more generally, when there is a high demand for mobile apps."

  "body": "Opening tickets to ask when your app will be available is a waste of time, as we will **not** reply to such tickets.\n\n* In case you're worried about your app request not having been received on our end, don't worry. If Control said your app request was submitted, then we received it.\n\n* Are you impatient? Unfortunately, you'll have to wait for at least one week before getting your iOS app. This is because of the always high demand for mobile apps and the Apple approval process (which already takes a full week). Thus, opening a ticket to ask us \"when will I get my app\" will **not** help at all.\n\n* Want to follow your app request status? You can do this in Control."

## Editing your app request

You can also edit your app request from Control at any time.

On the *Mobile Apps* page, there is a link to view more info about your request. When you click on it, your app request will be shown with all details, and you'll be offered the choice of editing it.

App updates are not always processed as fast as initial requests are, especially when we have a high demand for apps. Again, we kindly ask you not to open any tickets for this, as they're a waste of time for both you and us.

## About Android apps

On 2016-03-24, Google suspended our account. We're working on recovering the account. Unfortunately, Google is known not to reinstate accounts often or easily.

If you already had an Android app but can't find it anymore, this is because Google has taken down all of our apps.

In the meantime, we offer 2 options to get your app back in the Google Play Store.

The first is the option to self-host your app (under your own Google Play Developer account). There is an option for this in Control where you can request and download your APK. See [Self-Host your Android apps](#self-host-your-android-apps) for more details.

The second option is to get your app on our new Play Store account. Since Google limits new apps per day, this is ***much*** slower as there will be a waiting list. This will take as long as it needs to.

Therefore, **we strongly recommend self-hosting your app**, as that is more flexible for you, you get access to statistics and your account is independent from all other apps.

In both cases, you have to go to the app request details page in [Control](https://control.shoutca.st), edit and save it so we can process your app request again. You'll be notified when your app is resubmitted or when it is available for download.

  "body": "Google has suspended two apps for an invalid reason again. As they have a three-strike policy, we're appealing to avoid having our account terminated again. Submission of Android apps to the Google Play Store is suspended until Google resolves this.\n\nAndroid apps that are pending submission will stay on the \"Pending\" status for the moment.\nWe strongly suggest self-hosting the apps. These requests are the only ones that will get processed at this moment.",

## Self-host your Android apps


[block:callout]

  "title": "Own Google Play Developer account required",
  "body": "To host your Android app yourself, you need a Google Play Developer account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for one here](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).\nAmazon also offers a free alternative at the [Amazon App Store](https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/submitting-your-app)"
}
[/block]
You have the possibility of hosting your Android app on your own Google Play Developer account.

On the request details page, edit the app request, then tick the "Self-hosted" checkbox.

Save the request, then wait for the app to be built by us. You'll get an email once it is ready.

Once it has been processed (you'll get an email), you'll find the link to download your APK as well as the screenshots to use for the Play Store listing on that page.

To publish an app, simply open the [Google Play developer console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) (not to be confused with the browser's developer console), then click on "Add new application" and follow the steps.

## Unpublishing your app(s) from the app store(s)

This cannot be done automatically in Control. You'll have to request this by opening a ticket (mentioning your app name and your username).
