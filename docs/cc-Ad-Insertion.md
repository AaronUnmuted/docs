title: "Ad Insertion"

---

> New signups for this have been delayed till we get earning reports for the current stations in this program from SHOUTcast.com. We've waiting for these for ~~months~~  years to pay out the current stations but did never get them from SHOUTcast.com.

~~SHOUTca.st is proud  to provide a way to monetize your stream in partnership with SHOUTcast. By triggering two minute ad breaks twice per hour your are able to earn money by serving your listeners ads targeted to their location and music taste. All you have to do is send the trigger from your automation, and our servers insert the audio commercials automatically! 
Note: To apply for this your station must have reached at least have 500 TLH per day.~~

## Is my audience big enough?
~~You can check this under “Report” inside Centova Cast, there make sure to select “Yesterday” as the time. After that you can see your TLH under the “Listeners” tab. To qualify for monetization your station must have 500 hours of listening per day.~~

## How does the revenue generation work?
~~You run audio ads on your station by playing 2 minute "triggers" in your programming. This trigger tells the SHOUTcast server to send a series of four :30 ads to your listeners. You don't have to do anything to schedule or record the audio ads, they're handled automatically on the server. All you have do to is play the trigger when you want to run a commercial break. The minimum number of ad breaks per hour you should trigger is 2. The maximum is 5. You also need to wait 5 minutes between ad breaks (you cannot trigger them back-to-back)~~

~~The ads that the listeners hear are streamed directly to them from our SHOUTcast servers, and each listener hears separate ads depending on what city or country they are listening. (This is called server-side targeted advertising). The advertisers that you will hear on your station include major brands like Geico, Wallgreens, McDonalds, Honda etc.  And the ads in the US come from Targetspot and in Europe we have partnerships with other ad agencies in several countries with more coming soon.~~

## How much will I make?
~~We can give you a rough estimate of what your monetization potential would look like, though your results will vary due to the many variables in play. This is just an estimate...~~

~~Lets say your U.S. hours per month add up to 66000 TLH (this is the total sum of the U.S. TLH for all the days of a month).  The CPM charged for commercials varies depending on the advertiser, time of year, etc. but let's use a $2.75 CPM since the actual amounts are almost generally more than that.~~

~~So, using approximate and conservative estimates our estimate looks something like this:
As a revenue generating station, 60% of the revenue from the commercials on your stream goes to pay the advertising team's costs, the salaries of the people selling the ads for your station, and the cost of the software and support that are doing the work to make the ads play.  The rest, 40%, goes to you!  Let’s make an example where the advertisers are is paying an average $2.75 CPM (CPM means to cost per thousand) for commercials. In this example, from the $2.75 revenue for each :30 spot, you get $1.10 (which is 40% of $2.75).  So, if you accumulated 66000 listener hours over a month, then that would add up to $72.60 if one :30 were played every hour ($1.10x66). But keep in mind that since you are required to trigger at least two 2-minute stopsets every hour (eight :30 spots), the revenue for this example would be 8x bigger, or $580.80 total for the month.~~

~~If you played twice as many ad breaks, obviously your revenue would double. It is up to you whether you want to increase the number of commercial breaks per hour on your station.~~

> ~~Important Caveats
> With the above example in mind, the actual money you’ll be getting depends on \n1) your actual audience listener hours (TLH) in monetized countries and \n2) the spot fill rate. If all eight :30 spots per hour are NOT filled by the salespeople, or if you miss triggering some breaks then your revenue will be proportionately less. As you may know, in radio the fill rate varies depending on time of year, etc. and it is almost never 100%.~~

## How do I get started?
~~First of all make sure you have an account at the [SHOUTcast RMO](https://rmo.shoutcast.com) and to add your station there (select DNAS 2.4). Once that is done send us a support ticket mentioning this program with your RMO username (and authhash) so we can set this up for you.~~

## How to trigger your ads?
~~To activate each stopset of ads, all you need to do is schedule a 2 minute "trigger file" with the tag "Advert:" in the artist and title sections. Note that the audio in your "trigger file"  will be heard by listeners in countries that don't have ads playing. However, the audio in the "trigger file" will be covered by ads in the US, several European countries - anywhere you’re your station is being monetized. What that means is that you should make sure your trigger file containes audio that you want people to hear if they're not hearing ads at that time  (yes, you can create more than one "trigger file"). You can make the file any way you want (even serving your own ads or promos under it is fine), but the ID3 "meta" tags will have to be correct to fire the ads and generate your revenue.~~

~~Once the metatada from the two-minute file is received by our servers, the system injects a unique set of two minutes of targeted ads for each of your listeners. The metadata to activate the ads is "Advert:" in both artist and title song fields. Note that the advertising server is case sensitive, so make sure to use a capital “A” and the colon.~~
