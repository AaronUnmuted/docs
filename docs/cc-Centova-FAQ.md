## What URL do I need to send to TuneIn

TuneIn needs a direct link. You can find that link under Tune in links under Quick Links. For example mine here is `http://curiosity.shoutca.st:8006/stream`
> This link is also the one to be used in 3rd party player widgets.

## How can I modify the start page?

The start page is meant for testing purposes only. We strongly advice against using it as a website!

## Where is my FTP?

You can find your FTP details on the Quick Links in Centova Cast.

> Make sure you leave the port field empty or use port 21. Using the port of your server will result in an error;
