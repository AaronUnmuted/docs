title: "What is this?"

## If you don't know what any of this means, you probably are not concerned by this section about APIs. Have a nice day!
We at SHOUTca.st enjoy a "hacker lifestyle". Before you ask, no, that doesn't mean we hack into systems, it just means we love changing systems to meet our needs. This allows us to serve you the best possible. But why would we limit this power to ourselves? We love power users, and that is why we opened up our APIs so you can build software that works great with our services!

## REST APIs
Almost all of the services we built have APIs following the REST standard. This makes it universally usable to everybody. You can find all available functions here in the documentation.

## Open Source
We believe open source is the future! Our systems are fully dependent on open source software, so why would we keep ours closed? We have open sourced projects like Cast and Player. Soon, ITFrame and Control are to follow. You can find them all on [GitHub](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies).

>To guarantee backwards compatibility, we will release versioned APIs in the future which are intended for public use. We don't mind you trying to find the ones we use, and possibly undocumented or even internal endpoints, but do note they might change over time.
