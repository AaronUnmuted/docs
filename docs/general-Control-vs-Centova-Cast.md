title: "Control vs Centova Cast"

---
SHOUTca.st currently has two offers. The Centova Cast offer is a classic approach to Internet radio streaming with an AutoDJ and SHOUTcast/Icecast. On the other hand, we have Control, an in-house developed panel with the latest technologies and our own streaming server called Cast.
Control is still under heavy development and currently doesn't offer polished features you might find in other solutions (such as an AutoDJ).

> Both offers have a free plan or trial. We strongly suggest trying it out for free before you order a paid plan. If you upgrade, you won't lose your settings and data!
