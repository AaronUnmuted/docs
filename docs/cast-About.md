Cast is an open source radio streaming server developed by SHOUTca.st. It is designed to bring modern technology to Internet radio as well as expanding the possibilities. Cast is made to not only look great but to give the user a great experience. With Cast, you don't have to be an expert with legacy systems to get started.

Cast is open source meaning you can use it yourself for free, change it and contribute to the project. You can find Cast on [GitHub](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies/Cast).

Cast is licensed under AGPLv3. To keep it simple, you can modify it if you release the source code with your modifications. As soon as your Cast server is publicly accessible, and even if you only modify it for your own radio station, you have to disclose the modified source. This is done to benefit everybody with the open source spirit.
