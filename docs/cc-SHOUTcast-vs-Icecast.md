title: "SHOUTcast vs Icecast"

---
Both SHOUTcast and Icecast are very similar software. At first sight you won't see a difference between the two. in detail there are a few differences.
Icecast is open source (GPL) software while SHOUTcast is freeware made by Radionomy SA (before that AOL and Nullsoft). Both can be listed on SHOUTcast.com however.
If you plan to have a big audience where you want to play ads to we can suggest SHOUTcast. SHOUTca.st has a partnership with SHOUTcast.com that allows you to play targeted ads to your audience and earn money. You can learn more about that under "Ad Insertion".
On the other side Icecast is better tested against thousands of listeners.

## Do I need an MP3 key for SHOUTcast?

MP3 keys were only needed in the past with sc_trans (TRANScast). This software is not developed anymore therefore we replaced it with Liquidsoap a more modern software which doesn't require an MP3 key. 
Furthermore MP3 keys are not being sold anymore, any company trying to sell them to you is technically doing illegal business.

## Can I have SHOUTcast v1?

SHOUTcast v1 has not been updated for over 11 years and never will. Also there are many bugs and even serious security vulnerabilities know to be in there. Therefore we decided to not offer SHOUTcast v1 servers anymore.
SHOUTcast.com also decided to stop supporting SHOUTcast v1 for their directory. Very soon these servers won't be listed anymore.
On top of that the latest versions of Webkit (used in Chrome, Safari, Opera and many more) stopped to support SHOUTcast v1 servers which makes it unable to play SHOUTcast v1 stations in most modern browsers. For this reason SHOUTcast.com has decided to unlist all SHOUTcast v1 servers from their website rendering SHOUTcast v1 useless.
