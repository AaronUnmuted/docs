You can pay in British Pounds (GBP), US Dollars (USD) and Euros (EUR). You will keep paying the price you see on your first invoice, so if you chose Euro, you will keep paying that price in Euro and are not affected by any changes in the currency market.

We don't store any credit card details for security, therefore we can't automatically charge it every month. If you like this we suggest PayPal or Direct Debit.

If you want to use PayPal, select PayPal as your payment method for your invoice and use the *Subscribe* button there. PayPal will then automatically send money to us every month. (the button is only visible on invoices on first order and invoices paid before the due date)

To use Direct Debit (EUR, GBP only) make sure this is your default payment method on your account. To do this open "Edit Account Details"

If your card got rejected or when an invoice is not marked paid after a payment this means our system was not able to receive a successful payment. Therefor our payment processor can not confirm and send the money to us. 
If you still see a charge on your account, that can be a *pending* charge. Meaning it won't settle. If you are unsure about this we suggest to contact your bank. 

In case you get any error on the payment we suggest contacting your bank for the exact reason for the failure or trying an alternative method such as PayPal.

We already offer a lot of different payment methods which are accessible to most, if not all people. We probably won't add any more unless there is a big demand, as adding new payment methods costs money and time to us.

In most cases, if you cannot pay via PayPal, you still have the option of using your credit/debit card. If that isn't possible either, there are still bank transfers and Bitcoins.

**No.** We will never support Western Union because of the high risk for fraud and the impossibility to integrate it with our systems.

In the Client Area you can add funds to your account. These will be credited on your account and used to auto-pay all future invoices (note: if you have invoices open the funds will not cover those).
