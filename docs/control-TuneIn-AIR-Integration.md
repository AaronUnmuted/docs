Requesting the TuneIn AIR API keys is a manual process and it might take some time before they answer your email with the keys you need.

Requesting them is very simple:
1. Make sure you are already listed. [You can add your station right here.](http://tunein.com/syndication/new/?IsBroadcaster=true)
2. Send an email to broadcaster-support@tunein.com mentioning your TuneIn station URL (to get it, search for your station on TuneIn.com) for permission to use the API, and they will grant a partner ID and partner key.
